*Takashi Murakami, I see colors all around me  
I keep seeing stars but I'm driving in an Audi  
If you ain't down to ride, then why are you around me?  
Money bang my line and I like how it's sounding  
Paper towel bankroll, stacking up my bounty  
Haters see this cheese and they can't stop frowning  
All this water on me, everywhere I go I'm drowning  
Murakami pillow, living life so comfy*
